# Tooberz
Tooberz is a open source project where small content creators can gather together and grow together. It works by having text channels where you can speak to other content creators after taking a short quiz. You can learn from other creators and watch eachother's content for feedback. It is basically like a messaging app with other benifits catered for content creators.
